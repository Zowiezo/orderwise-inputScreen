# inputScreen

This project implements a user-friendly feedback form with various functionalities using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

## Functionalities

- **Character Limit**: Each text box holds a maximum of 40 characters. If the user exceeds the character limit, a new text box is created below the current one.
- **Alternate Styling**: Every alternate text box has a different background color for visual appeal.
- **New Line Button**: Clicking the "New Line" button inserts a new empty text box below the existing ones.
- **Character Limit Cap**: Once the user reaches 1000 characters, further input is restricted.
- **Removal Prompt**: When the user clicks the "X" button to remove a text box, confirmation is prompted if there is any text present.
- **Dynamic Display**: As the user types, the complete text is shown in a dedicated text box at the bottom, enabling real-time review of input. If the text exceeds the capacity, the font size is dynamically adjusted.
